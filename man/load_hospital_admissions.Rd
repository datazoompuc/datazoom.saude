)
}
\arguments{

For example, \code{2020} or \code{2015:2020}.}

\item{states}{A string or vector of strings indicating the Brazilian state(s) for which the data should be downloaded.
Use \code{"all"} to download data for the entire country. For specific states, use abbreviations like \code{"SP"}, \code{"RJ"}, or \code{c("SP", "RJ")}.}

\item{raw_data}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns the raw data exactly as provided by DATASUS. If \code{FALSE} (default),

}
\details{
SIHSUS provides several datasets related to hospital admissions in Brazil:

\describe{
\item{RD – Reduced AIH (Hospital Admission Authorization)}{
A simplified database with the main information from approved and processed AIHs.
It is the most commonly used dataset for statistical and epidemiological analyses, including
data on the main procedure, diagnoses, and total values of each admission.}

\item{SP – Professional Services}{
A stratified dataset containing details about services provided during the hospital stay,
such as medical procedures, professional identification (CBO/CNS), and values related to
professional and hospital services.}

\item{RJ – Rejected AIHs}{
Contains rejected AIHs and summarizes the reasons for rejection. It is useful for analyzing
the volume and impact of rejected records but does not include detailed information on each rejection.}

\item{ER – Rejected AIHs with Error Code}{
Includes AIHs rejected due to inconsistencies identified during processing. These records contain
specific error codes indicating why the rejection occurred (e.g., patient data inconsistency,
procedure incompatibility).}
